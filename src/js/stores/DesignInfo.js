      "The brief set by RAILS (Refugee and Immigration Legal Service) required a full rebrand of their website, logo, and business cards. The company had requested a rebrand that both showed professionalism and appealed to families with children. ",

      "In my concept design, I used clean typographic elements and layout to give the designs a professional and contemporary feel,and created custom illustrations to bring an element of friendliness back to the brand. ",

      "To begin designing the brand elements, I started by doing rapid concept sketching for the RAILS logo and the illustrative elements, as I knew that they were both important components of the RAILS brief. This then developed into manipulating type, crafting illustrations and designing colour palettes in Illustrator. When I was happy with these elements I began working them into business card and website designs; finding the most appropriate and professional layouts for the brief. ",

    explanation: [
      "The aim of this project was to design a typeface which highlighted the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. In addition to this, I wanted the typeface to be funky, contemporary, and be able to be used in broader placements. This is why I’ve created my destruction element as a set of alternate character. The base set of this typeface would be perfectly suitable for a wide range of placements. It would particularly be effective in posters and advertising, due to its mono-line, uppercase structure.",

      "To save it from being harsh, and to keep with the contemporary feel I wanted to achieve, I’ve made the arms and crossbars of many letters (e.g., E and H) slightly higher than the centre line. I’ve also made some interesting retro style curves (e.g. B and D) which also portray this feel.",

      "In displaying my type poster, I have been strategic in all elements to make the outcome effective. My most reflective is the precise placement of the alternates. Not only do they spell out the word “grief” but they are also roughly the same percentage of letters destroyed in the poster as the amount of the Great Barrier Reef that was destroyed in 2016. I’ve also displayed my type in white which reflects the bleaching, and this also bleeds down into my coral imagery, which has some bleaching beginning to fade into the rest of the coral.",
