Not only do they spell out the word “grief” but they are also roughly the same percentage of letters destroyed in the poster as the amount of the Great Barrier Reef that was destroyed in 2016. I’ve also displayed my type in white which reflects the bleaching, and this also bleeds down into my coral imagery, which has some bleaching beginning to fade into the rest of the coral.",
